# EasyToDo
Easy ToDo is a convenient task planner that will help you organize your life and increase productivity. With this app, you can create to-do lists, set reminders, track task progress, and much more.  

## HomeScreen
The application's home screen displays a list of tasks assigned by the user. Completed tasks are always at the bottom of the list. There are also three buttons on the screen: “Settings”, “Add task” and “Sorting”.
  
When you click on the “Settings” button, the settings window opens in full screen. In this window, the user can change various application settings such as language, sound notifications and others.  
When you click on the “Add task” button, a form for creating a new task opens. The user can enter a task name, select a due date, and add comments if necessary.  
  
The “Sorting” button opens a window with a choice of different ways to sort tasks. The user can choose to sort by due date, priority, or other parameters.

## Adding and editing tasks
The task editing form and the task adding form are similar to each other. They contain the same fields for entering task information, such as title, due date, priority, and comments.  
  
To call the form for creating a new task, you must click on the "Add task" button at the top of the main screen.  
  
To open the form for editing an existing task, you need to swipe the desired task to the left. After this, two options will appear: the blue “Edit task” button and the red “Delete task” button.  

When editing a task, all form fields will already be filled in with information about the current task. The user will only need to change the fields that he wants to update and then click the "Update" button.

## Notifications and settings
On the application settings screen, you can select the interface language(only english supported), turn notifications on or off(deleted from settings), turn iCloud synchronization on or off(will be later), and switch the theme from light to dark.  
  
When a task is due, the app sends a notification to the user to remind them to complete the task.

## Widgets
The application also contains widgets that can be added to the home screen of the device. However, due to the use of the swiftData library, widgets are not interactive. Instead, they serve as a link to the app itself, redirecting the user to it when clicked.
